# Credentials_DB

## Intro 
This program acts as a password and username manager. A light-weight database is created and inputs are encrypted with a password supplied by the user. Then each set of credentials is stored one entry at a time.
The idea is that the user can store each set of credentials with a unique password or instead use one good password to manage all their credentials.  


### Setup
There are two executable files. 'Credentials' is a command-line based version. 'Credentials_GUI' is a simple graphical version built with Pythons Tkinter module. Place them on your desktop and double click to open. 

### Security
While this is not the most secure credentials manager ever built, it is miles safer than storing any passwords or usernames in plain text. Since this program is not exposed to the web, any attempts of intrusion would require someone having full access to your computer. And even then, they would need to go about breaking the encryption.
